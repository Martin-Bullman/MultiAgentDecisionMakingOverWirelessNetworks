    Multi Agenda Decision-Making Over Wireless Networks
</h1>

<p align="center">
    <em>
        The demand for real-time decision-making, propelled by diverse data sources, is increasingly significant
        across various industry sectors. Conventional applications typically entail collecting data from an array
        of widely distributed sensors, transmitting it to a centralized access point for informed decision-making.
        The resultant decisions are then communicated to remote actuators, enabling devices to perform tasks based
        on the outcomes.

    <em>
        In response to this imperative, we researched and constructed a testbed for real-time decision-making over
        wireless networks. This involved utilizing multiple Intel Galileo embedded microcontrollers and implementing
        a novel protocol that exemplified the principles of sensing, communication, actuation, and coordination.

        Data Analytics Annual Conference. Supported by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Grant SFI/12/RC/2289.
